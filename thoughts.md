Takeaways from initial Mod 0 Sessions as it relates to success at Turing:
* well thought out notes, supplemented with charts, diagrams, and color coding can be an invaluable resource for your overall success
* taking time to do work outside of coding environments is crucial. actions such as psuedo-coding can really help you get your mindset into the problem you're trying to solve. It also helps you make sure you actually understand the task at hand.

During Mod 0 - I'm committing to:
* take better notes than I ever knew I could take when I was in highschool and undergrad
* pratice coding to some degree every single day, to try and utilize the info being taught during the Mod 0 sessions.


Shoutout to Vanessa Randall - an awesome friend who encouraged me to try coding, encouraged me to apply to Turing, and has been an awesome friend and supporter since I've met her. She's an awesome lady, and if you are fortunate enough to know her, you are better off for it.
