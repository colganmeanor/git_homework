Takeaways from initial Mod 0 Sessions as it relates to success at Turing:
* well thought out notes, supplemented with charts, diagrams, and color coding can be an invaluable resource for your overall success
* taking time to do work outside of coding environments is crucial. actions such as psuedo-coding can really help you get your mindset into the problem you're trying to solve. It also helps you make sure you actually understand the task at hand.

During Mod 0 - I'm committing to:
* take better notes than I ever knew I could take when I was in highschool and undergrad
* pratice coding to some degree every single day, to try and utilize the info being taught during the Mod 0 sessions.
